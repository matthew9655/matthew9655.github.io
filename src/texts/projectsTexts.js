        "description1": "Vehicle tracking and occlusion handling are important issues in the field of self-driving cars. Occluded vehicles can result in \
        the creation of new tracks. This reduces the efficacy of tracking algorithms. Together with a teammate, we create an algorithm to match tracks using \
  heuristics based on the shapes and sizes of vehicles. We implored the use of the UnionFind algorithm to efficiently join tracks together.",

        "description1": "Beta Variational Autoencoders (VAE) have been shown to be able to disentangle latent variable generative models, this means that \
        individual latent traversals correspond to particular changes in features. For example, on the celebA dataset of faces, \
        traversals can affect baldness or skin color, etc. We then used this framework on the sentence-VAE to try to disentangle sentences.",
