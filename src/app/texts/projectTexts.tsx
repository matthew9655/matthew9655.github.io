        the creation of new tracks. This reduces the efficacy of tracking algorithms. Together with a teammate, we create an algorithm to match tracks using \
  heuristics based on the shapes and sizes of vehicles. We implored the use of the UnionFind algorithm to efficiently join tracks together.",

        individual latent traversals correspond to particular changes in features. For example, on the celebA dataset of faces, \
        traversals can affect baldness or skin color, etc. We then used this framework on the sentence-VAE to try to disentangle sentences.",
